This lesson introduces the translations process used by [the R project][r].
It is intended for people that are completely new to this topic, 
to help them understand ways in which they can contribute.

The lesson was originally delivered as two [Collaboration Campfire][campfire] sessions.
We hope that this material will be helpful for people that would like to 
run a similar session in future, or potential contributors or translators that would like to
go through the material themselves.

The Collaboration Campfires were organized as part of the project [Building Community around the R Development Guide](https://incubator.codeforscience.org/cohort), lead by Saranjeet Kaur and Heather Turner, which was supported by the Digital Infrastructure Incubator at [Code for Science & Society (CS&S)](https://codeforscience.org/). The project benefited from the input of community champions from groups such as R-Ladies and members of the R Contribution Working Group.
